# Music_Store_Analysis_SQL
This project focuses on analyzing the Music Store database using SQL, helping beginners understand and apply essential SQL concepts. Through this project, I learned to write and optimize queries to derive business insights, such as identifying customer spending patterns, the best-selling artists, and other key metrics for business growth.
